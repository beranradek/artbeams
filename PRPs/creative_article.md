I have now opened my CMS administration editor of my important article about author
(http://localhost:8080/admin/articles/f05f712c-590f-11e9-8647-d663bd873d93/edit) and I want you to make the article more creative while
still professional and fix some badly looking leading boxes describing "Kdo jsem?" interleaved by author's portraits ![Portrét Radka
1](/media/author-main.webp?size=300#left) and ![Portrét Radka 2](/media/author-trip-3.webp?size=400#right). I want these boxes and photos
look more professional, photo portraits rounded and interleaved with boxes in similar way the https://www.margit.cz/margit/ (article about
Margit Slimakova) looks like. Use your frontend design skill to improve my page about author creativelly. Do not hold back. Make it
professionaly nice and creative. Use your browser tools to edit the article on the URL described, for saving the article, reviewing in at
final URL http://localhost:8080/muj-pribeh, taking screenshots of it and tunning it further. Markdown of articles uses CSS styles
according to style guide that you must read in /home/radek/dev/artbeams/docs/style_guide.md. If you need to add another styles (you will
probably to do so), add them into /home/radek/dev/artbeams/src/main/resources/static/css/articles.css, rebuild the app (this also minifies
the styles and merges them into styles.css) and re-run the already running app. At http://localhost:8080/login, you can login as
administrator: admin / adminadmin
