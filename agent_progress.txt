=== ArtBeams Enhancement Project - Agent Progress ===

PROJECT TYPE: Existing Kotlin/Spring Boot CMS application
ENHANCEMENT SCOPE: Fix search compilation errors + Member section UI/UX improvements

=== Current Application State ===

Technology Stack:
- Kotlin 2.2.0 + Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4.11
- PostgreSQL with JOOQ 3.19.16
- FreeMarker templates with Bootstrap CSS
- Gradle build system

Build Status:
- FAILING: Compilation errors in search feature (SearchIndexRepository, SearchIndexer)
- Root cause: JOOQ classes not generated for search_index table
- search_index table EXISTS in database schema (src/main/resources/sql/create_tables.sql:312)

Main Application Entry Points:
- Main class: org.xbery.artbeams.ArtBeamsApplication (assumed, standard Spring Boot)
- Public site: http://localhost:8080/
- Admin section: /admin/*
- Member section: /member/* (focus of enhancements)

Key Directories for This Enhancement:
- src/main/kotlin/org/xbery/artbeams/search/ - Search feature with compilation errors
- src/main/kotlin/org/xbery/artbeams/members/ - Member section controllers
- src/main/kotlin/org/xbery/artbeams/userproducts/ - User product logic
- src/main/resources/templates/member/ - FreeMarker templates to enhance
- src/main/resources/static/css/ - CSS files (assumed location)

Existing Templates to Modify:
- memberSection.ftl (1,874 bytes) - Landing page, needs hero image + "Moje produkty" heading
- userProduct.ftl (314 bytes) - Product detail, needs complete redesign with image

Controllers:
- MemberSectionController.kt - Serves memberSection.ftl
- UserProductController.kt - Serves userProduct.ftl

=== Features to Implement (See feature_list.json) ===

Total: 20 features across 4 tasks

Task 1: Fix Search Compilation Errors (5 features)
- Generate JOOQ classes for search_index
- Fix missing imports and method references
- Ensure clean build

Task 2: Product Detail Page Enhancement (3 features)
- Display all product info including Product#image
- Professional visual design

Task 3: Member Section Landing Page (2 features)
- Use /media/member-section-image.webp (with fallback)
- Add "Moje produkty" heading

Task 4: Creative UI/UX Design (10 features)
- Bold, distinctive aesthetic (NOT generic AI patterns)
- Calming/night/winter theme matching healthy sleep concept
- Unique typography (NOT Inter/Roboto/Arial)
- Animated hero section (stars/lights effect)
- Atmospheric backgrounds and depth
- Unexpected layouts and micro-interactions
- Responsive across all devices
- Unforgettable user experience

=== Development Commands ===

See CLAUDE.md for full reference. Key commands:
- ./gradlew generateJooq - Regenerate JOOQ classes after DB schema changes
- ./gradlew clean build - Full clean build
- ./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=local' - Run locally
- ./gradlew test - Run tests

Environment Setup:
- Copy src/main/resources/application-local-template.yml to application-local.yml
- Configure database connection and API keys
- Use ./start.sh to build and run (created in this session)
- Use ./stop.sh to shutdown (created in this session)

=== Implementation Plan ===

Priority 1 (BLOCKING): Fix Compilation Errors
1. Run ./gradlew generateJooq to generate SearchIndexRecord
2. Fix missing imports in SearchIndexRepository
3. Add missing create/update methods to SearchIndexRepository
4. Locate/create NormalizedStringUtils if missing
5. Verify ./gradlew clean build succeeds

Priority 2: Functional Enhancements
1. Update userProduct.ftl to display Product#image and all product info
2. Update memberSection.ftl for conditional hero image and "Moje produkty" heading

Priority 3: Visual/UX Enhancements
1. Research distinctive font pairings (NOT generic web fonts)
2. Define color palette (calming night/winter theme)
3. Design animated hero section with stars/lights
4. Create atmospheric backgrounds and visual depth
5. Design product card hover effects
6. Implement responsive layouts
7. Add micro-interactions and page load animations

=== Session 1 Accomplishments ===

✓ Read and analyzed app_spec.txt
✓ Created feature_list.json with 20 comprehensive test cases
✓ Created user_escalations.json (empty, ready for issues)
✓ Created start.sh, stop.sh, restart.sh scripts
✓ Analyzed existing codebase structure
✓ Identified compilation issue root cause (missing JOOQ generation)
✓ Documented project state in agent_progress.txt
✓ Committed initialization files to git

=== Next Session Recommendations ===

1. IMMEDIATELY run ./gradlew generateJooq to fix compilation
2. Fix all search-related imports and methods
3. Verify clean build before UI work
4. Read existing CSS files to understand current design patterns
5. Review memberSection.ftl and userProduct.ftl current state
6. Begin visual redesign with bold, distinctive aesthetic
7. Test thoroughly after each feature
8. Update feature_list.json marking "passes": true as features complete
