## Current Tasks

## Upcoming Tasks (Backlog)
- [ ] I created new design (components and styles) for my artbeams project / web, using the Lovable service and the result is in repo c:\dev\vysnenezdravi-lovable, 
and online for preview at URL https://preview--dreamy-vysnene-visions-landing.lovable.app/. 
Read the repo and fetch the URL and create comprehensive plan in REDESIGN_PLAN.md in artbeams project root, 
plan that describes how to lead and fully implement redesign. 
I like the clear component structure, but my web is not using React and for my development skill, simplicity and easy maintainability, 
I want to preserve my poor bootstrap and plain CSS and JavaScript solution if possible. 
I want to use new components (their markup, CSS styles) in public part of the project (web) only, not in administration. 
Can you do the comprehensive reseach of the provided repo, web, my project and write the comprehensive plan into REDESIGN_PLAN.md with desired structure for my artbeams project, implementation steps
filled with concrete files and components, including migration of my images, reworking my templates, current CSS styles and possibly some JavaScripts? 
JavaScript functionality should be mainly preserved from my current web site. Write the plan so the AI programming agent can easily follow it and implement the whole redesign.
